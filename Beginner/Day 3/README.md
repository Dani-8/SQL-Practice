# Day 3 - Grouping, Sorting, and Functions

Welcome to Day 3!  

Today we explore **GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and various functions** to manipulate and analyze data.


## What you’ll learn:

- How to **group data** and calculate totals per group using `GROUP BY`
- How to **sort data** with `ORDER BY` (ascending & descending)
- How to work with **strings** using `CONCAT()`, `REVERSE()`, `TRIM()`, `POSITION()`, `ASCII()`
- How to work with **dates and times** using `CURDATE()`, `NOW()`, `DAY()`


Run the queries in `Day 3.sql` step by step to follow along.  

> 🎯 End of Day 3: You now have a strong foundation in SQL queries and can manipulate data effectively!


```sql
use new_sql;
select * from emp_details;
