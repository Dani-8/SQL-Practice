# Day 2 - Filtering and Aggregating Data

Welcome to Day 2!  

Today we practice **filtering data** and using **aggregate functions**.


## What you’ll learn:

- How to **filter rows** using `WHERE` with single or multiple conditions (`AND`, `OR`, `IN`)
- How to **count records** using `COUNT()`
- How to **calculate sums and averages** using `SUM()` and `AVG()`
- How to **select specific columns** from a table


Run the queries in `Day 2.sql` step by step to follow along.  

> ✅ End of Day 2: You can now analyze your table by filtering and summarizing data!


Remember to run:

```sql
use new_sql;
select * from emp_details;
