-- Day 5

/*
Today we are going to learn about SQL JOINs.
SQL JOINs are used to extract data from different tables
using one common column between them.

Example:
We can join a Students table and a Courses table
using a common column like student_id.
*/

/*
There are mainly four types of SQL JOINs:
INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, & UNION.
*/

show databases;               -- List all databases to see what exists

create database student_db;   -- Create a new database for student tables

-- ==================================================================== 

-- ==================================================================== 

/*
INNER JOIN:
Returns only records that exist in BOTH tables.
*/


-- Why this query: to show students who have at least one activity.
-- Why INNER JOIN: students without activities are excluded.
select s.student_id, s.name, a.activity_name
from students s 
inner join student_activities a
on s.student_id = a.student_id;
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

/*
LEFT JOIN:
Returns ALL students, even if they have no activities.
*/


-- Why this query: to identify students who are not involved in any activity.
-- Why LEFT JOIN: students are the main table, so we include all of them.
select s.student_id, s.name, a.activity_name
from students s
left join
student_activities a
on s.student_id = a.student_id
where a.activity_name is null;

-- Why this query: to count how many students are not involved in any activity.
-- Why LEFT JOIN: students are the main table, so we include all of them.
select count(*) as no_activity_name
from students s
left join
student_activities a
on s.student_id = a.student_id
where a.activity_name is null;
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

/*
RIGHT JOIN:
Returns ALL activities, even if the student does not exist.
*/


-- Why this query: to find activities that are not linked to any student.
-- Why RIGHT JOIN: activities are the main table, so we include all of them.
select s.student_id, s.name, a.activity_name
from students s
right join student_activities a
on s.student_id = a.student_id
where s.name is null;

-- Why this query: to list all activities with the number of students in each
-- RIGHT JOIN ensures all activities are included, even if no students
select a.activity_name, count(a.activity_name) as activity_count, count(s.student_id) as student_count 
from students s
right join student_activities a
on s.student_id = a.student_id
group by activity_name
order by student_count desc;
-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

/*
FULL OUTER JOIN (using UNION):
Returns ALL students and ALL activities, matched if possible.
*/

-- Why this query: to see everything from both tables in one result.
-- Why UNION of LEFT and RIGHT JOIN: MySQL Workbench does not support FULL JOIN directly.
select s.name, a.activity_name
from students s
left join student_activities a
on s.student_id = a.student_id

union

select s.name, a.activity_name
from students s
right join student_activities a
on s.student_id = a.student_id;


-- Why this query: to find all "unlinked" records in both tables
-- UNION combines students with no activities and activities with no students
select s.student_id, s.name, 'No Activity' as info
from students s
left join student_activities a
on s.student_id = a.student_id
where a.activity_id is null

union

select a.activity_id, a.activity_name, 'No Student' as info
from students s
right join student_activities a
on s.student_id = a.student_id
where s.student_id is null;

/*
Now we are going to import the ClassicModels database in MySQL Workbench.

Steps:
1. Download classicmodels.sql as a ZIP from this link:
   https://gist.github.com/dronavallisaikrishna/aa569525a7dbce32cc2465beb2138a7d?utm_source=chatgpt.com
   → Save to Downloads and extract the SQL file
2. Open MySQL Workbench and connect
3. (Optional) Create a clean database:
   CREATE DATABASE classicmodels;
   USE classicmodels;
4. File → Open SQL Script → Select classicmodels.sql → ⚡ Execute
5. Refresh Schemas → classicmodels with tables appears

That’s it 👍
