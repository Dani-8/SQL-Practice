# Day 1 - SQL Basics

Welcome to Day 1 of SQL learning!  

Today we focus on **setting up your database and tables** and running your first queries.


## What you’ll learn:

- How to **show existing databases** and select one to use
- How to **create a new database** for practice
- How to **create tables** and understand their structure
- How to **insert data** into tables
- How to **view data** using `SELECT *` and `DESCRIBE`
- How to see **distinct values** using `DISTINCT`


Run the queries in `Day 1.sql` step by step to follow along.  

> 🎉 End of Day 1: You now have a database with a table full of employee data to practice queries on!
