# Day 4 – GROUP BY, HAVING & JOINs

In Day 4, we move from basic filtering to **summarizing and analyzing data**.

Today you learned:

## 🔹 GROUP BY
- How to group rows that share the same values
- How to use aggregate functions like `sum()`, `avg()`, and `count()` with groups
- How to analyze data per department, city, and year

## 🔹 JOINs (Level Up 🚀)
- How to use data from **multiple tables**
- Calculated revenue and profit using `inner join`
- Learned how table aliases (`s`, `c`) make queries cleaner and readable

## 🔹 HAVING
- How to filter grouped data
- Difference between `where` (filters rows) and `having` (filters groups)
- Applied conditions on aggregated results
